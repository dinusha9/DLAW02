# blocking: papers

This directory contains papers relevant to the problem of finding and using blocks to reduce the number of pairwise compairsons necessary in record linkage and database deduplication.

Please add only pdf files that are licensed for public use, e.g., by a creative commons license. Papers that are not available by a public use license should be referenced and linked here.

A starting point for this problem is Patrick's [blogpost on a simple approach to adaptive blocking](https://hrdag.org/tech-notes/adaptive-blocking-writeup-1.html).

Mark referred to a literature review he has begun with Duncan.
